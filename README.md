# Malware-Analysis
Some scripts and tools that i wrote to help me

- export_crc.py : Scan System PEs, get export functions, calculate crc32 and store. Usefull for malwares that use crc32 APIs gathering

- synack.py : a dirty IDA script that i made to deobfuscate SynAck ransomware sample. This sample is one of the first on the wild to use the Process Doppelg√§nging technique, and has some fun obfuscation, including on the APIs imports/call.
